Sector 1: 

The user authorization process requires accessing and verifying credentials across all necessary services: Google, AWS, Jira, Miro, Toggle Tracker, GitHub, and DockerHub.
---------------------
Sector 2:

This sector outlines the creation of manifest files in YAML format for various Kubernetes resources.
	- The first manifest defines a StorageClass, enabling volume creation.
	- The second manifest creates a PersistentVolumeClaim, claiming a volume.
	- The fourth manifest deploys another service with mounted volumes, focusing specifically on volumes within the /usr directory.
----------------------
Sector 3: 

Section 3 outlines the pre-deployment steps, including authorizing access to a Jump EC2 instance, establishing a connection to the EKS cluster, switching to the appropriate namespace, and verifying connectivity to the Node Group, ensuring a smooth and secure deployment process.
---------------------------
Sector 4:

Section 4 dives into deploying the StorageClass, detailing the steps: uploading the manifest file, establishing the StorageClass itself, and the subsequent automatic volume creation, streamlining storage provisioning for your application.
------------------------------
Sector 5: 

Section 5 outlines the deployment of the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC), guiding you through uploading the manifest file and subsequent PVC creation. This empowers your application to request and utilize persistent storage seamlessly.
----------------------------------
Sector 6: 

Section 6 delves into the deployment process, guiding you through applying the deployment manifest, creating the deployment resource, spawning a replica set, and finally launching individual pods, orchestrating the entire application rollout in a step-by-step manner.
-------------------------------
Sector 7: 

Section 7 tackles automated pod storage attachment, demonstrating how to specify StorageClass and PersistentVolumeClaim information within your manifest file. This ensures seamless storage provisioning for your deployed pods.

------------------------------------

Sector 8: 

Section 8 dives into content migration, guiding you through executing the created pod, copying all files from /usr to the mounted /mnt directory, and then verifying memory usage remains consistent across both directories. This final step confirms successful migration and data persistence within the mounted volume.
