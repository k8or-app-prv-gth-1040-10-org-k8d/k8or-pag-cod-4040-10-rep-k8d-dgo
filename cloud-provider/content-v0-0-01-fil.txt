Kubernetes Cluster Deployment and Management on Major Cloud Providers
This document outlines the challenges and strategies involved in designing, building, configuring, and installing Kubernetes products across various cloud platforms. It specifically addresses major cloud providers and their Kubernetes offerings, including AWS EKS, GCP GKE, IBM Cloud Kubernetes, Oracle OKE, Digital Ocean DOKS, Openshift Container Platform, Alibaba ACK, and Microsoft Azure AKS.
Streamlining Kubernetes Deployment on AWS Cloud: A k8or Approach
Contextual Inquiry: When deploying a predefined architecture and product list on AWS Cloud, what is the optimal strategy? Should one opt for cluster-native resources, cloud-native resources, or a hybrid approach?
The Challenge:
Cloud providers simplify Kubernetes control plane management, but the responsibility of selecting, configuring, and installing numerous Kubernetes products remains. This task is often time-consuming, error-prone, and demands specialized expertise. Key issues include:
- Understanding Gap: Selecting the appropriate products necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the available options and their distinct features.
- Skill Shortfall: Once a product is chosen, mastering its configurable parameters and intricacies presents a significant challenge.
- Resource Inefficiency: Manual configuration and management of individual products lead to wasted time and heightened risk of errors.
- Security Concerns: Incorrect configurations can introduce significant security vulnerabilities.
- Scalability Limitations: Custom-built clusters often lack the flexibility and scalability of pre-configured solutions.
- Deployment Inconsistency: Achieving consistency across various environments is challenging without standardized configurations.
