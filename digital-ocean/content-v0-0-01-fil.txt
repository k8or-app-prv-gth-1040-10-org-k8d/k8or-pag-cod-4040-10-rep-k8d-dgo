Tailoring the kubernetes cluster with Pre-Selected Products on Digital Ocean DOKS: An In-Depth Look

	Here's a detailed map and guide to building a k8or cluster using managed services on Digital Ocean DOKS:

	Managed Services:

		Container Orchestration: DOKS itself is the managed service for running Kubernetes clusters on DigitalOcean. It handles upgrades, patching, and scaling, making it ideal for beginners and experienced users alike.

		Database: While DigitalOcean doesn't offer a fully managed relational database service, you can easily integrate with external providers like:

			Cloud SQL: Google Cloud offers MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Aurora MySQL as managed options.

			Amazon RDS: AWS provides a variety of managed relational database engines.

			Azure Database: Azure offers managed MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB instances.

		Continuous Integration/Delivery: Utilize CircleCI or Travis CI for building, testing, and deploying your applications to the cluster. Both integrate seamlessly with DigitalOcean through APIs and offer various build configurations.

		Messaging/Streaming: Leverage Apache Kafka deployed on a separate Droplet or Managed Kubernetes cluster. While not a directly managed service, DigitalOcean provides documentation and tutorials for setting up Kafka on their platform.

		Service Mesh: Currently, DigitalOcean doesn't offer a managed service mesh option. You can explore open-source options like Istio or Linkerd and deploy them alongside your applications within the DOKS cluster.

		API Gateway: Utilize Kong or NGINX Ingress Controller for managing and securing external access to your applications. Both can be deployed on a separate Droplet or within your DOKS cluster and offer flexible API gateway functionalities.

		Monitoring: For comprehensive monitoring of your cluster and applications, integrate Prometheus and Grafana. Deploy them on separate Droplets or within the DOKS cluster and leverage their capabilities for metric collection, analysis, and visualization.

		Logging: Employ Fluentd for centralized log management. Deploy it on a separate Droplet or within the DOKS cluster and configure it to aggregate and forward logs to a centralized solution like ELK Stack.

		Storage: Depending on your needs, consider:

			DigitalOcean Block Storage: Block storage for persistent volumes attached to applications.

			DigitalOcean Spaces: Object storage for unstructured data like backups and media.

			DigitalOcean Managed Databases: While not directly for containers, these managed databases offer persistent storage options you can access from your DOKS cluster applications.

		Container Registry: Store and manage container images securely with Docker Hub or a Private Docker Registry hosted on a separate Droplet or within your DOKS cluster.

	Deployment Steps:

		Create a DigitalOcean Account: Sign up for a free tier account.

		Launch a DOKS Cluster and set up a basic cluster using the DigitalOcean control panel or CLI.

		Configure Additional Services:

			Databases: Set up and configure chosen managed database service with appropriate access from your DOKS cluster.

			CI/CD: Create and configure your chosen CI/CD platform with integration to DOKS and your code repository.

			Messaging/Streaming: Deploy and configure Apache Kafka on a separate Droplet or Managed Kubernetes cluster and integrate it with your applications.

			Service Mesh: Deploy and configure your chosen open-source service mesh option within your DOKS cluster.

			API Gateway: Deploy and configure Kong or NGINX Ingress Controller on a Droplet or within the cluster and connect it to your applications.

			Monitoring/Logging: Deploy and configure Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluentd on separate Droplets or within the cluster for comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities.

			Storage: Create and configure chosen storage options based on your application needs.

			Container Registry: Set up your chosen container registry solution and ensure secure access from your DOKS cluster.

		Deploy Applications: Use kubectl or Helm to deploy your applications to the DOKS cluster, leveraging container images from your chosen registry.
